# 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction | Machine Learning [LINK](https://github.com/Rakesh00966/Lung-Cancer-Prediction/blob/main/Lung_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **lung cancer risk** based on lifestyle, medical, and behavioral factors using supervised machine learning models.  
By analyzing survey data of 309 individuals, the goal was to identify significant health indicators contributing to lung cancer and build an accurate predictive model.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze and visualize the factors associated with lung cancer occurrence  
- Encode categorical data and prepare it for modeling  
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models  
- Identify and save the best-performing model for future use
